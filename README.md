# Restaurant Food Ordering App

My first mobile app was created using Android Studio.


## Features
### 1. Restaurant Listings
The app utilizes the RecyclerView to present a user-friendly list of local restaurants. Users can easily scroll through the available options and explore different cuisines.

### 2. Menu Exploration
Upon selecting a restaurant, users can view its menu, complete with a variety of dishes and options. The user-friendly interface allows users to browse through the menu items and view detailed descriptions.

### 3. Cart Functionality
To streamline the ordering process, the app features a shopping cart where users can add their desired items. The cart dynamically calculates the total cost, including individual item prices and a delivery fee.

### 4. User Registration and Authentication
To place an order, users are required to register with the application. This ensures a secure and personalized experience. Returning users can log in using their credentials.

### 5. Order Placement
After finalizing the order and reviewing the total cost, users can proceed to place the order. For registered users, this process is straightforward. For new users, the app guides them through the quick and easy registration process.

### 6. Order Status Tracking
Once an order is placed, users receive a confirmation message.

### 7. Order History
Registered users can log in to the app to view their order history. This feature allows users to keep track of their previous orders, making it easier to reorder favorite dishes.
